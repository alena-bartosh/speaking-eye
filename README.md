   * during one day  
     <img src="doc/reports_examples/one_day_en.png" width="450">
   * or as many days as you like

### Installation and use

Speaking Eye can be installed in two different ways: for developing and for regular using (production).  
The simplest way of installation is

```
pip install speaking-eye
```

Anyway, you will need some system dependencies. Please see all steps on [wiki pages](https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/wiki/Installation).

#### Basics

After successful installation and start, you will see a tray icon. A running Speaking Eye (**SE**) has two states: 
   * [active](https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/blob/master/icon/light/active.png) (open; for working time);
   * [disabled](https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/blob/master/icon/light/disabled.png) (crossed out; for free time).

Use the active SE to track your work. For this check the box *'Work Time'* in the context menu.
Eye is open: it thinks you are working. It will tell you about breaks, overtime and distracting activities. 
Use the computer as usual and show what you are capable of!

***Break*** in SE terminology ‚Äî is ***a locked screen***. So when you get tired, just lock the screen for a while.
After finishing work at the end of the day, change the status to *disabled*. 
Eye is crossed out: it thinks you are not working. It will not talk to you, but will continue to collect information about your activity.

You also can close SE with *'Close'* in the context menu. Eye is closed: your browser activity is still tracked by ISP and Google. üôÉ

#### Config

For a comfortable interaction with SE, please fill in [the config](https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/blob/master/config/config.yaml). 
Here you can choose the color theme of the icon and set time limits for notifications. 
Also choose which activity you want to track (it is necessary) and which apps are considered harmful or distracting (optional).

*'work_time_hours'* ‚Äî is recommended to count with lunch. If *work_time* = 8 hours and *lunch* = 1 hour then it's better to set *work_time_hours: 9*. 

To track a specific group of applications, follow this pattern:

```
- Reading about my favorite project:        # save selected windows activity under this title
    wm_name: Chromium|Firefox|Opera         # x11 window manager names
    tab: speaking-eye                       # look only at a specific tab in the window

# E.g. let's open 3 links in 3 different browsers: 

# Chromium: https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/actions
# Firefox:  https://speaking-eye.ua/whats-new
# Opera:    https://www.google.com/search?q=speaking-eye

# In this case SE will save all these activities as 'Reading about my favorite project'
```

[Additional config example.](https://github.com/alena-bartosh/speaking-eye/blob/master/config/config_example.yaml)

#### Data

SE saves all collected data to ```speaking-eye/dest``` into ```{date}_speaking_eye_raw_data.tsv``` files that contain
such columns for each activity:

```
start_time, end_time, activity_time, wm_class, window_name, is_work_time
```

#### Reports

Reports are generated dynamically based on files with collected SE data and actual application groups in config.
For reports displaying Dash server is used. You can configure it in application config and open report page by clicking on *'Open Report'* in the context menu.

```
report_server:
  host: localhost
  port: 3838
  browser: firefox
```
***SE analyzes only work time (when eye is active and open)!***

### One-time start
```sh
make start
```

### Set auto start
Speaking Eye will automatically turn on after system startup
```sh
make install/systemd
```

### Run type checking & linter & unittests
```sh
make checks
```
### Demo

### üêå Possible improvements

* Now SE uses ```xprop``` (a program that can list and set ```x11``` window properties). In the future we may want to use other window managers. Is it possible to get an active window using ```dbus```?
